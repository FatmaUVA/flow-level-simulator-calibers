1) orgiginal:
for each completed flow
find MBL
consider only flows in MBL


2) new_local_sched_ver_1_rehsape_based_on_te.py
find all involved flows
find flow with max te
find path of max te flow
assing more bw to max tc flow

3) newnew_local_sched_ver_1.py
find all involved flows form all involved paths (use set operations to lower complexity to O(F)
find MBL by finding flow with max te,
if flow with max te traverse many links
then MBL is the link with max te and highest avg te (without max)
consider flows in MBL when destributing bandwidth

have same complexity in worstt case with global,however in average
if the average path size is 2 links, and pairs re uniformly distributed
and arrival rate of xx request
